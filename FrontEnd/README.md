1. HTML (Login Page)
Structure: The HTML file defines the structure of the login page.

A form is used to collect the user's email and password.

Two links are provided: one for Forgot Password and another for Sign Up.

Firebase SDK: The Firebase SDK is included to enable authentication functionality.

Styling and Scripts: External CSS (styles.css) and JavaScript (app.js) files are linked for styling and functionality.

2. CSS (styles.css)
Styling: The CSS file styles the login page to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.

The page is centered on the screen using flexbox.

Input fields, buttons, and links are styled for better usability.

Hover effects are added to buttons and links for interactivity.

3. JavaScript (app.js)
Firebase Initialization: Firebase is initialized using your Firebase project configuration. This connects your app to Firebase services like Authentication.

Login Functionality:

When the user submits the login form, their email and password are sent to Firebase Authentication for verification.

If the login is successful, the user is redirected to the dashboard or home page.

If the login fails, an error message is displayed.

Forgot Password:

When the user clicks the "Forgot Password" link, they are prompted to enter their email.

Firebase sends a password reset email to the provided address.

Sign Up:

When the user clicks the "Sign Up" link, they are redirected to a sign-up page (which you can create similarly).
------------------------------------------------
How It Works Together

The user opens the login page and enters their email and password.

When they submit the form, Firebase checks the credentials.

If valid, the user is logged in and redirected to the dashboard.

If the user forgets their password, they can request a reset link via email.

New users can click the "Sign Up" link to create an account.

Next Steps Can be 


Replace YOUR_API_KEY, YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN, etc., with your actual Firebase project credentials.

Deploy the frontend to your Azure App Service or any static hosting service.

Implement the backend (Node.js) to handle additional functionality if needed.
